# Generalized-harmonic-numbers
Week 2 - Conditionals and Loops


Assignment details

Write a program GeneralizedHarmonic.java that takes two integer command-line arguments n and r and uses a for loop to compute the nth generalized harmonic number of order r, which is defined by the following formula: H(n,r)=11r+12r+⋯+1nr.


For example, H(3,2)=112+122+132=4936≈1.361111.

Note: you may assume that n is a positive integer.

The generalized harmonic numbers are closely related to the Riemann zeta function, which plays a central role in number theory.
